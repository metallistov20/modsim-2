# SW and HW parts for simulation of 3G-/LTE-modems to test SoHO hadware, ver0.2

Besides tentative "platform=PC" whoich is used for local testing of algorithms only,

there are two 'real' hardware platforms:

a) 'floatless' MC68EZ328-based uCsimm/uClinux (platform=DRAGONBALL)

b) 'BeagleBone Black' AM3358-based Beagle/Linux (platform=SITARA)

On 'a' the <Port E> is used to sumulate levels of USB 2.0 on CPE#1 gate

On 'b' the <GPIOs> is used to simulate levels of USB 2.0 on CPEs CPE#1-CPE#5

STATUS: BEING EVALUATED
